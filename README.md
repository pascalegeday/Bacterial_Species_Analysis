# Bacterial Species Analysis
# Overview
A company that develops plant-based substitutes for meat products, Improbable Beef, wants to experiment on bacterial species found in the human's navel, as another way of producing a meat flavor for meatless products. However, we need to analyze and visualize each sample taken from human volunteers to have a better understanding of the bacteria living in each person's navel. To do so, I've created a webpage that showcases a panel for demographic information and visualizes the bacterial data for each volunteer. As a result, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
