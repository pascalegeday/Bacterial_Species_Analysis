# Bacterial_Species_Analysis
A company that develops plant-based substitutes for meat products wants to experiment on bacterial species found in the human's navel, as another way of producing a meat flavor for meatless products. However, we need to analyze and visualize each sample taken from human volunteers to have a better understanding of the bacteria living in each person's navel. To do so, we've created a webpage that showcased a panel for demographic information and visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers themselves should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
